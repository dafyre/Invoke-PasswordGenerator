I made this function due to needs of generating a random password. 

I was unable to find documentation for an API at http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net/,
so I kept looking and found http://getanewpassword.com/api/generatepassword, which does support REST API.

Note: http://getanewpassword.com does not support POST, even though it says it does on the front page.
